## Product description

Our hottest sauce with so much depth of flavour. It's packed with umami flavour that lingers. This sauce has a decent kick of heat and allows your taste buds to travel to Venda where the very soil and organically grown chillies give life to layers of flavour from every element that has been part of the growing process. The fermentation gives each storyline in the production of the chilli the ability to add its own flavour into the final mix.
