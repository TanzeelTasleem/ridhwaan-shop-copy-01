      - title: MADE WITH NATURAL INGREDIENTS, NOTHING FAKE
        description: "I was tired of artificial ingredients and refined sugars. Using
          fresh red African bird’s eye chillies, salt and white wine vinegar, I
          made a chilli sauce that has a unique flavour . The texture and colour
          are made by the chillies. It’s not thickened or sweetened. Without
          preservatives, the sauce may separate. The solution: a good shake."

      - title: COMBINING THE BEST HEALTH BENEFITS OF CHILLIES + FERMENTATION
        description: There is no sugar added. The little natural sugar that the chillies
          had has been converted to lactic acid. Chillies are also anti-diabetic
          (treats diabetes). The good microbes that make the flavour in
          RIDHWAAN’s ORIGI - NAL CHILLI SAUCE are also the probiotics you gut
          needs. Ingesting them, you get all the benefits of improved
          microbiota.
